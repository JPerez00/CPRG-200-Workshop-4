There are no restrictions on the interface you choose to build. You are free to design the GUI as your team decides. Ensure that the navigation is user-friendly. Your application will need functionality that will allow the user to maintain the data in the tables listed below.The agents need to add/edit travel packages.  This function must allow the user to enter data for the package, and select from a product list to add products to the package.The application will also require simple add/edit access for maintaining the product, suppliers, and product_suppliers data.
